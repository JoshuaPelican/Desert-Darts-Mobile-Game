### Endless Mode

**TODO**
Add max distance value for spines to spawn away from each other

Add Highscore

Add X number of Lives

I think I want difficulty settings also:
- Easy
	- Increased Target Size
	- Lower Intensity Strength
	- More Lives (5?)

- Normal
	- Default Target Size (What it is now)
	- Medium Intensity Strength
	- Lower Lives (3?)

- Hard
	- Smaller Target Size
	- High Intensity Strength
	- 1 or 0 Lives?

Raise volume on normal spine hit

On spine miss, delete current spine pattern to prevent instant spawns, giving delay to player

##### End Condition

**Ideas**

Usually its like losing all your lives or something
	- Would require a screen clear effect when you miss tho, and missing is definitely more likely in this game

Could be a time based mode, given the multiplicative nature of Intensity this could be cool.
	- Given a set time limit, how many points?
	- Encourages high Intensity play and rewards big points
	- High score mastery
	- Short games = easy to pickup
